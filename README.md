This project was created out of frustration that nobody is providing a visual maze builder that I needed for a project in college,
that project was a failure but it left me with a relitavely good GUI, so I decided to make it public so people don't face the same problem
as I did. It has been about a year since I made this project, and now I modified some stuff I didn't like, added a DFS algorithm as 
example, and made it possible to write and read existing mazes object in .txt files, there are already three existing mazes (and a fourth
created by mistake) feel free to modify anything, and if you create an algorithm please Fork it in the repository.

The maze solving algorithm was taken from this video on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyrvXiMumXc.

This is my first official public Contribution to GitHub :D
